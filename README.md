# # Courses Schedule


A tool to facilitate the creation and management of a course schedule, allowing teachers and students to organise their timetables clearly and efficiently.
## Description
This project helps to generate a course schedule automatically or to modify it easily. It allows you to:
- View courses over a week or a month
- Avoid timetable conflicts
- Receive reminders for upcoming courses
- Use the tool on the internet or a mobile app
### Project explanation
Students will enter three availability options into the app so that it can suggest three different timetables with each student's hours, making it easier for students and teachers to decide on a timetable.
